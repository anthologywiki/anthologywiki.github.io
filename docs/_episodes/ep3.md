# EP 3: IT IS EVERYWHERE

> the rain has finally stopped. fog pours out from the mountain and fills up the valley that the town sits in. in the forest, the antler god stretches its too-long limbs, unlocks its jaw, and bellows up at the moon. it isn’t happy. not yet. too much has been taken from it. it’s not like in the before, when it was brimming with power. it needs to take what it’s owed, and it needs a soul in order to complete itself. as the fog lifts, the damage of the rain reveals itself. cars stuck deep in the mud, and the road out of town flooded near the bridge. not that anyone was planning on leaving, surely, but there are no buses making their way in now, either. not until the water goes down. not until the repairs are made.

## FIELDMOUSE

> YOU FEEL LIKE YOU’VE BEEN IN A DAZE —
>
> all week and you’ve been tired, sore. you wake up with mud underneath your nails and dark circles underneath your eyes. there are bruises on your skin in strange whorling patterns, almost floral, but more disjointed. you keep tending to the little mushroom garden in your home. you ignore the way they grow, the way they escape out of the opened confines of the vivarium and into your room. across your walls. you spend too long staring at the mirror in your shower, until you’re in such a daze your eyes match that same milky white you saw in the rabbit. you blink them hard, and when you open them you see a shadow behind you, with horns that stab at your ceiling. you whirl around, but nothing is there.

## ELK

> A VISION SLANTS IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES —
>
> but it’s all wrong. it’s worse than usual, you can feel it pounding behind your eyes. everything has been more immersive since you picked up that bracelet. it’s not now. the present. you see your sibling again, streaking through the forest, like they’re leading you somewhere. past the tree with eyes, up a hill, around a forked tree until the stop at the mouth of the old cave. your sibling laughs and runs off through the snow, back to the brambles. but you’ve seen that already, so you stand in place as the snow melts in reverse - as you settle into fall, and then summer. years in the past. more than you can easily discern. two figures walk past you holding a large box between them. they disappear into the cave. you try to follow after them, but pain wedges into your skull as fast and hard as an axe cleaving into you. you blink your way back into the present and curl your hands around your head, like you’re trying to put the fractured pieces of yourself back together. it’s only when you don’t feel the pain subsiding that you let go. that image remains burned in your head, though. those people in clothes from so long ago. of that box.

# PLOT PROGRESSION SCRIPTS

**main cast:** stag, doe, snake, lamb, dove, bat, starling

## WORSHIP

**starring:** old god's flock

> the flock sits together outside, in their old hangout spot back in high school (aka a flattened out field not too far from the woods and not to close to the town). they’ve spread out blankets and they try to ignore the damp that still sticks underneath. it’s coming out in bits and pieces between drinks: the dreams that everyone had, the strange events that seem to have followed. the more everyone drinks, the less scary everything seems. surely nothing bad can happen, not when they’re together like this. lamb pulls out their phone to take a picture of everyone sprawled out. they click a few shots of everyone in frame, including their own smiling face. when they go to review their pictures, they see a looming figure in the background. it sits in the shadows of the trees, settled oddly on four legs. antlers shoot from the top of its head. it almost looks like…it’s grinning. lamb drops their phone and allows for the others to see.

> _please write a thread in continuation of the script investigating the forest for the weird figure. due to the large group of individuals, one thread will consist of 2 muses and the other will consist of 3. director’s note: stag and doe must split up._

> > > you’re all deeper in the forest than you would like, but it’s going on twenty minutes and nobody has seen anything of note- just trees and trees and trees. you’ve almost decided to head back when you hear the crunching of sticks behind you. everyone freezes and you listen to the breathing of something large. it’s the same thing from your dreams, you just know it. it’s real. it’s real and it’s here, right now. its voice echoes around you, like it’s talking from everywhere at once, a mouth in every tree. “you gave to me what i needed. i will remember that.” the crunching grows louder, like hooves against rock. it talks low near stag’s ear “i will remember you.” you all catch a glimpse of the horns as it turns to leave, catching only the briefest glimpse of an impossibly large body as it moves away, like a deer, but larger, with a spine that slants crooked and wrong. your group returns to the clearing first

> > > you all/both take off in the opposite direction. you move fast, to cover more ground, but you still listen hard and wait with baited breath to hear signs that it’s nearby, wait to hear your other friends screaming. it gets to a point where you decide to turn around, double back. only, you wind up back at the same spot, evident by the large rock jutting out from the ground. at first you don’t notice it, the sound. you can’t put a name to it at first listen, but then it becomes more apparent as it goes on and on, growing closer and closer. it’s a laugh you realize, albeit a strange one. “you’re after something aren’t you? power.” the voice speaks to everyone, but doe feels like it’s aimed directly at her. “i can give you that.” doe feels something scratch against her nape, rough. she remembers the antlers from the picture and turns fast, but nothing’s there. “you must promise to follow me. you must give me more than anyone else can, and for it, be rewarded.” A stumbles back like they’re pushed and they reach out to catch themselves. there’s a screech and a scream before A comes back with a handful of fur, and B/A has a jagged cut along their forearm, like something that would come from the sharp tooth of a predator, not the worn flat teeth of a deer. your group returns to the clearing second

## UNKNOWN

**starring:** bat, starling

> the voice has been pestering bat lately, more than usual. it tunnels into their skull and echoes around in their head, a vicious buzzing that won’t leave them alone. the voice wants them to visit starling, wants them to spill truths that bat doesn’t want to give up. so bat ignores the voice that shrieks in their skull until thin lines of red start dripping out from their ears, trickling down their cheek. it’s not until everything sounds muffled from the angry buzz and clotted blood that they visit starling to tell them what the antler god wants them to know.
>
> #### **SUBMIT TO BAT**
>
> > in your plot progression thread, the antler god wants you to tell starling that they are a prophet, like bat themselves is. you can tell this is a lie. you’ve been listening to the voice for far too long now. but it wants you to speak this lie like a truth, that starling should listen to the recordings they find, that come from their own mouth, that they should follow them. that if they do, everything wrong in their life will be absolved. it is up to you how truthful your muse is with the information (ie: acting like this is the truth or not), and how they would like to tell them.

# GENERAL SCRIPTS

**all are two muse scripts**

## SCRIPT ONE

> muse 1 swears they can hear a voice around town. they’ve heard rumors about voices coming from the forest, but not the town. it sounds…almost familiar, but they can’t pinpoint where they know it from. it’s hard to make out the words, too. they enlist muse 2 to help them. eventually, they find an old radio slid back behind the aircon unit of mija’s place. they turn the volume up and listen: “so, there was this creature. and it lived in the forest. it just lived, you know? but then people came. and you know how people are, with their trophies. and they wanted to catch it. to trap it. so they did. and how is that fair? how is that fair? how is that fair?” the end repeats in a warped glitch. you pop open the radio and pull out the cassette, but the tape’s all unspooled. muse 2 furrows their brows in thought before wondering out loud: “isn’t that starling’s voice?”

## SCRIPT TWO

> muse 3 wakes up from a nightmare with a sharp inhale that they choke on. they’d been running from something. something large. something that speared them through with an antler. they climb out of bed and stumble into the bathroom to splash cold water on their face. they look up, expecting to find a bedraggled expression. instead, they’re looking directly into the eyes of muse 4, who seems to be having a similar experience.

## SCRIPT THREE

> both muses are taking a walk now that the rain’s been gone and the ground has somewhat dried up. it’s dusk, the world coloring itself in a dark wash of blues and grays as it folds into night. on the way, they notice a sprig of mushrooms growing along the side of the road. it wouldn’t be that strange, expect for the fact that they’re almost bioluminescent. a wash purple-blue that emanates out. they follow the trail of mushrooms that lead into town, not even the pavement can stop them. they grow through the asphalt, on the sides of building, they crawl up the length of a streetlight. they pulse like they’re something alive. and they stop at fieldmouse’s doorstep.

## SCRIPT FOUR

> both muse’s settle in for a movie night together at the decrepit, old school theater in town. as they settle into the chairs, the projector clicks to life - as if it had been waiting just for them. they see dark figures blurring together on screen, the edge of film reel, the static buzz of an error. but then it adjusts. they see themselves in the forest- an impossible reel, footage that wasn’t - shouldn’t have been - taken. there’s a figure behind them, large and hulking. its hooves thunder down hard against the rock, sparking up like fire. they watch themselves rush, crashing through the forest. stumbling. muse 8 falls and twists their ankle and next to muse 7. in the theater, they cry out and hold their leg like it really happened. like they’re really in pain. they hold their breath as it corners them, but instead of whatever it is they’re expecting, they both watch themselves fold up into a bow. the antlered thing waits a minute before it turns to leave. in that shot it looks directly into the camera- into their eyes. they feel the uncomfortable sense of being watched, despite the empty seats around them.
