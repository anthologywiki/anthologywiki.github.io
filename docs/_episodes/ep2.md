# EP 2: IT AWAKENS

> that electric undercurrent still hasn’t faded. with the storm clouds that roll in, it just builds and builds, hanging in the air and electrocuting the meat of an arm when it gets too close to metal. the humidity sits thick, waiting in the clouds, and everyone keeps looking up and expecting that downpour. some folks seem uneasy, crawling in their skin. they all seem to be around the same age, but nobody puts two and two together. instead, everyone watches as the clouds change from grey, to purple, to a brackish green; the sky’s imitation of a bruise now healing. and then one day, deep in the week, lightning flashes snake-fast and blinding, the footsteps of thunder following behind a beat too slow, powerful enough that the ground underneath the town trembles like a quake. the clouds open in a monsoon and the river overfills.

# PLOT PROGRESSION SCRIPTS

**main cast:** dove, stag, the order of the rabbits, magpie, fieldmouse, cat, fox, lynx, hare

## REPOSSESSION

**starring:** dove, stag

> stag hears a thump in their house. after their barrage of nightmares, this rattles them more than it usually would. they bunch up their blankets between their hands and listen harder. another series of thumps. the camera shifts angle and we pan to dove rifling through stag’s home. they’re looking for stag’s missing heirloom. the antlered creature visiting them in a dream again, like a god to a prophet, commanding them to find it. then bring the relic back to them, to the top of the mountain.

## THE RITUAL

**starring:** the rabbits

> you’re all drawn to a new page in the book. to perform it, step one notes that you need to be somewhere sacred. you all assume it must mean the berry bushes and trek into the woods. on the way, you see a rabbit. it bounds off kilter but pauses and looks back at you with milk-white eyes. an omen, cottontail whispers, and you all nod together as one before you follow it up, high in the mountains where the dirt turns red. the rabbit stops at the edge of a grave, so you do too.
>
> you can all feel it. this is the sacred place.
>
> step two, collecting bushels of flowers. the purple, vining masses surrounding the grave make it obvious that those must be it. you all tug them up and pile them, join hands in a circle around the mass and repeat the words in the strange language of the book. then, marsh takes a lighter out from their pocket and sets it on fire. the smoke spills up, a flood from below. you all inhale it and it stings the inside of your nose. angora is worried at first, that’s its toxic. before anyone can mention dousing it, or leaving, lightning streaks down from the sky right in front of you and wedges itself into that tree. it groans, and splits in half.
>
> everyone’s skin feels like it’s sparking, and that’s when you notice the animals, or creatures, or things coming out from the forest. some are more bones than pelts with distended jaws that clack as they cackle. rabbits on two feet whirling around them like they’re dancing. i think…it was hallucinogenic. that plant. brush says. i think the ritual worked. cottontail replies back. but what it did, exactly, nobody can say for certain.

## OVERGROWTH

**starring:** magpie, fieldmouse

> fieldmouse notices that the mushroom sample they’ve taken has multiplied. and then quadrupled. fieldmouse created a small vivarium for them, to give them more space as they document. it doesn’t make sense, but they have real time proof of it. they become even more enthralled. they almost don’t open the door for magpie when they come knocking, with advice they shouldn’t know. “hey, i heard you found some of those mushrooms near the marshlands. they grow better in the air.”

## ODDITY

**starring:** cat, fox

> things have been odd around town. it was always a little off, but that was in the time slowed way of separation. not…this. it’s a coincidence, really. fox is at the cafe, sorting through everything that had been sent to them in the mail. looking for clues. one letter slips down to the floor next to where cat is sitting. they stare too long at one of the strange letters and fox hurriedly yanks it back. they move to ignore them when cat moves to the chair opposite them and pulls out their phone. “you got sent those, right? me too. sorta. it called me.” they pull up their phone and navigate to the call log to show the voicemail saved in their phone.
>
> #### **IF THEY CALL THE NUMBER AGAIN**
>
> the line rings as cat sets it to speakerphone, and it’s a tinny sound. echoing. like a phone dropped down a well. cat glances down at their phone, unsure if it’s broken. it’s never sounded like this before. eventually, the line clicks to life and that same wet breathing is heard. “what do you want?” the voice reaches out from the phone, and this time it sounds more natural. like it’s remembering how to speak properly. it waits a beat for either of them to speak before the line goes dead.

## DELIVERY

**starring:** lynx, hare

> hare is around town, trying to outrun the feeling of eyes on their back. lynx stops in front of them. their eyes look unfocused, almost like they’re daydreaming. but in their hands they hold a tablet and hold it out to hare. carefully, hare takes it. as soon as the electronic is in their hands it starts setting off a notification bell. you look up at lynx, who nods, and gestures toward the I ACCEPT button now flashing on the screen.

# GENERAL SCRIPTS

**all are two muse scripts**

## SCRIPT ONE

> the rain refuses to stop. it thunders down against the town and soaks into the earth, until it’s soggy and gushing up mud between the cracks of old pavement. both muses decide to head out to the river to check the overflow level. on the way back out muse 1 slips into the river and is carried downstream, muse 2 struggles to get them out again. it seems like the river doesn’t want to let them go.

## SCRIPT TWO

> muse 3 and muse 4 both saw the lightning streak down from the sky, so bright they could barely look directly at it. when they closed their eyes after, they still saw it imprinted into the black of their eyelids like a brand. it had felt important, but neither of them could explain why. they decide to hike up the mountain, even in the middle of the rainstorm, and see what it hit.

## SCRIPT THREE

> muse 5 and muse 6 are at the cafe, working on their laptops, so the internet should be fine. but both of their screens start loading slowly. the video playing on muse 5’s fractures from the video they’re watching to a fixed image of a forest. almost like it’s a hidden camera. muse 5 notices a figure just out of frame, an antler that looks too long. not like a deer. not like a regular one. it freezes, turns its head toward the camera, and the computer force shuts down. blue screen of death.
>
> on the other side, muse 6’s music playing through their headphones changes into a chant. it’s not a language they’ve heard before. it builds until it starts to hurt their ears, but they can’t seem to stop listening. at a discordant yell, they lift up a hand and yank them free. both muses look at each other, equally bewildered. maybe they should try to find that spot in the woods. probably they shouldn’t.

## SCRIPT FOUR

> muse 7 and muse 8 are wandering the edges of the woods, the rain now a slower, lazier drizzle, when they hear a whisper. muse 7 swears it’s someone they know. it whispers again, traveling along on the wind. they move closer. the voice shifts in cadence, less beckoning and more scared. a sharp “help!” that’s hard to ignore. muse 8 throws themselves into the woods before muse 7 can stop them. they follow after them, until they’re both lost and deep in the woods. the voice has abandoned them. they must make their way out of the woods before dark. they can feel it in their bones. every so often, voices chatter around them like laughter.
