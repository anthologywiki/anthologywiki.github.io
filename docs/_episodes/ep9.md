# EP 9: REFLECTIONS AGAINST THE DARK

> the sky grows a darker shade of purple, mottled storm clouds overhead. no matter how many times lightning threatens to spark, a static wave through the clouds, and snow softly starts to fall, it dampens the noise. makes everyone feel that much more isolated. everyone keeps looking back over their shoulders, like they’re being watched. the antler god is angry, vengeful, everyone can feel it. it wants its heart back. it wants to swallow it down along with its five sacrifices and become whole again. all powerful. and it will never let the town bury it, pretend like it’s dead ever again. and in the face of that, most everyone comes together to show the pieces they’ve collected so far. the pages of the book, the tunnels stemming from the trapdoor. the heart etched into the door. the antler god yearns to bury his sacrifices; will they be able to bury him first?

# PLOT PROGRESSION SCRIPTS

**main cast:** stag, doe, cottontail, marsh, brush, angora, hare, snake, lamb/black sheep, elk, fieldmouse, dove, cat

## LOCK AND KEY

**starring:** stag, doe

> they saw the picture with the door, with the knife on one side and the heart trapped between it. so they venture down to the door together, to see if they can make heads or tails of anything that they find. they come across the door, but no amount of tapping or sliding the knife into the grooves of the thing opens the door. finally, doe notices that the carving of the heart is just deep enough that their locket might fit. she picks up the locket and presses it into place. the grooves around it are like a seal, and when she tries to tug it out it won’t come free. but that clasp, the one she was never able to pry apart clicks open, and tumbling out from the locket is a small sketch. something that their ancestors wanted to hide. stag and doe aim a light on the sketch and can make out what seems to be four vivisections of antlers being fit into the four keyhole gaps of the door.

## RUN RABBIT, RUN

**starring:** order of the rabbits, hare

> hare is in possession of the book, but they’re not telling anyone else about it, not even the rabbits, not yet. but they do meet with them. “we need to talk to marsh, it’s like that…thing has a hold on them.” cottontail says to hare and so that’s what they do. with all five together now, they feel settled. like they’re one again. whole. and everything seems to weigh down on their shoulders simultaneously. how the antler god has been manipulating them. pitting them against each other, running them in circles, and using them to weaken barriers in its own self interest. everything that has been given to them has come with a catch. it’s now that they notice they are sitting in a trap laid out by the antler god. that if they want to survive they need to band together. that they need to sever the collective state that the antler god has granted them. sever its hold on them completely. at that, hare gathers the book, and together, they burn it.

## WARD

**starring:** snake, black sheep/lamb

> snake brings their revelation about the mirrors to black sheep. sure, they’re bound to the antler god, but they’re also their friend. they’re still themselves, even if they have a connection to the antler god. and maybe the mirrors can help. maybe staring into them will keep the antler god at bay. so they try it, at first with a handheld mirror, and black sheep admits that they feel clearer of mind when they’re gazing into it. it’s snake’s heirloom that gives them both pause, because as soon as black sheep looks into it, they cry out and drop their hold. with a lucky catch, snake keeps it from shattering.
>
> **key takeaway: your muses should determine together that the antler god must be averse to mirrors, which has caused black sheep’s discomfort and may help you to ward it away from the cave when the group makes their attack on the heart.**

> #### **SUBMIT TO BLACK SHEEP UPON COMPLETION**
>
> > you feel the connection you have to the antler god. it stirs inside of you. its anger walks through your body like it haunts it. it is rage. and something echoes through the halls of yourself, not a voice, but a feeling. that connection, the way it’s trying to communicate. to help it get back its heart. because the lamb and the god are connected, so what do you think will happen to you if you kill me? that idea settles within them, something you’re forced to confront.

## CONNECTION

**starring:** elk, fieldmouse

> the angrier that the antler god gets, the more it seems to be impacting elk. angry slashes of visions that don’t make sense, a discolored past and present that makes them disoriented. makes it hard for them to think straight, to figure out what’s really happening and what’s a mirage. they find some amount of solace in fieldmouse, who was just as connected to the hivemind that the antler god controls. and it’s when they’re together, when fieldmouse is examining some of the purple plants that helped rid them of its hold that elk sees it. a sprig of the flowers between their fingers and a vision punches through. one of those visions that the elk knows it doesn’t want them to see, because they aren’t the right sacrifice, in the same way that fieldmouse wasn’t. they see the image of a door, of the old villagers carving key slots and runes into place around the shards of its antlers. a connection of the gods power to the heart that lays on the other side of the door. a way to open it.

## TICK TOCK

**starring:** dove, cat

> cat’s thrown themself into trying to uncover the mysteries of the heirlooms left behind - funny considering they were never handed down one of their own. so they approach dove, the hoarder of so many heirlooms in the past, and they agree to inspect theirs together. “no matter how you try to fix it, it doesn’t work. it just stays frozen at 3 o’clock.” dove tells them with a nod. “so, it’s the time then, right? but for what reason.” cat muses back.
