# EP 7: POISON THE WELL

> the antler god grows stronger. anyone can tell by the way the sky darkens above them, bruise-ripe and waiting to spill rain down on them, cold and red as wine. in the town, black sheep grows disoriented. they’re not the same, not like they were before. some part of…it got in. some look at it like black sheep is still themself, most of themself anyway. maybe others are scared. but everyone can feel it closing in, the antler god. its succession into power feels inevitable. and what will happen to them when it reaches its apex? what will happen to the town? but it’s angry, can’t you tell? someone points out, and it is. things didn’t go exactly as it wanted. maybe there’s room left for them still, to escape.

# PLOT PROGRESSION SCRIPTS

**main cast:** starling, fieldmouse, marsh, brush, bat, fox, hare, doe, dove, lynx, lamb/black sheep

## MAZE

**starring:** starling, fieldmouse

> fieldmouse keeps finding themselves hiking back into the mountains. not to get away from things, or further their own research. no. it just feels…weirdly familiar. like they’ve been here before. and maybe they have. maybe the antler god forced them to be here. it’s on one of these hikes that they run into starling on their way to daesan temple. they’ve heard about the voices, and considering they keep hearing voices around town (their own included), it feels like a good next destination. so they go together. fieldmouse lets the heavy feeling of deja-vu cloak them as they step into the temple. it takes a minute before they can both pick out the dying sound of a tape recorder on loop. nobody has been back to replace the batteries in a while. and it’s as starling is trying to locate just where the sound is coming from that fieldmouse pries up a loose floorboard shadowed in the back to reveal a trapdoor that descends into what must be the mines. “i’ve been here before. i think i left that here.” fieldmouse admits as they nod to the dying tape recording set on the run of a ladder descending down into the mountain.

> **close it and go home (no further reply from ag)**

> **descend the stairs to investigate**
>
> > starling and fieldmouse ease themselves carefully down the ladder. it’s old, and it’s hard to tell exactly when it was built. maybe around the same time as the first iteration of the temple. finding the ground at the bottom doesn’t improve things, and they’re forced into using their cellphone flashlights to guide the way. it seems the cave splits into multiple pathways and avenues. the route they take seems to lead them deeper into the mountain. another turn brings them to a pool of stagnated water that sits in a murky green pool when one of them shines their light into it. eventually their batteries get low enough that they decide to turn back. only, it seems different now. they aren’t sure if it’s because the dark of the mines has them disoriented, or if things are really out of place. better not panic.

## TOIL AND TROUBLE

**starring:** marsh, brush, bat

> marsh, now in possession of the book, does the first thing they always do. find brush. if there’s anyone who can understand marsh’s point of view, it’s going to be brush. only, on the way out to the woods to collect the mushrooms, they find bat standing there like they’ve been waiting for them, a grin on their face. “i heard you could use some help” bat says, tipping their head. marsh and brush wonder together, in their own heads, if whatever is going on with her is similar to the order. “it’s happy with you. your decision.” bat continues and leads them past the fairy circle and into the muck of the marsh where the fluorescent fungi grow. “and now…we have to grind them up.” brush says in the the middle of their collecting. “and now…into the water.” marsh says later, dumping the concoction in the pond by the dam of the river, where it feeds into the groundwater and wells. they all watch it pulse that strange purple-blue underneath the water, like a rippling tide of bioluminescent algae. “this will be better than the rain.” bat decides, but they say it in an unsettlingly unfamiliar cadence. marsh crouches to open the book again. next, find the cave and feed its mouth.

## MASQUERADE

**starring:** fox, hare

> it’s through cottontail that hare hears about the book. it’s easy to agree that there’s something unsettling about it at this point. fox wants nothing more than to take that book back, get rid of it, burn it, whatever might hinder the antler god. so fox figures out a plan. the best way to get into a group of rabbits is to send in someone who looks a whole lot like them. it’s the best chance they have of getting the book back - even if hare doesn’t agree with fox about what to do with it once it’s in their possession. how do they know destroying it won’t make it worse?

## HEARTFELT

**starring:** doe, dove

> dove doesn’t trust the antler god since seeing what happened to lamb, and since watching everything that transpired, doe’s not too sure they do either [if they’re fully leaning into morally abhorrent character it can be: and while doe’s not too sure they agree with them, dove does bring up an interesting point one day. “do you ever know what happened to your locket?” and…dove isn’t sure they know where it is by now, not after so many months ago when they first gave it to the antler god. “we just…have to trick it. it’s not in our heads. not like other people. not like lamb.” and dove, who was such an ardent collector for the antler god in the past promises to refind the heirlooms, to keep them safe. and doe, always eager to play a part, follows dove into the forest to see if it might guide them in the right direction.
>
> _once in the forest, the antler god will give them this clue echoing through the forest: if it’s with another person, clue here. otherwise: dove’s phone buzzes in their hand, and they make out a grainy picture of a locket at the base of a tree, a tree that is looking back at them_

## ECHO

**starring:** black sheep/lamb, lynx

> lynx was against this. after watching what fieldmouse went through, they think it’s easy to determine that if someone isn’t a true sacrifice it won’t work out. that it will be detrimental to whoever’s at the other end of that soul connection. so they find themselves in front of black sheep one day, this time entirely of their own volition. they should feel the same way about them as any of the other sacrifices, but it’s different, when they look in their eyes. the black sheep feels…changed. changed in a way that calls to them, and by virtue of that, lynx knows it’s bad. “people are avoiding me.” black sheep says, and lynx nods. “this shouldn’t have happened.” lynx says and black sheep nods and then shrugs. “it’s like a part of me is with it, and a part of it is with me. i can feel its…emotions, i think. but it’s not like you. it’s not…overpowering me. it was the ring, i think. that made a difference.” those heirlooms, they must’ve had a purpose. the heirlooms that the antler god has continuously been trying to wrangle out of their grasp. to hide them. “sometimes it’s scared. it never goes near the cave.” black sheep says, and they both look toward the forest.
>
> #### **IF THEY INVESTIGATE DEEPER IN THE CAVE**
>
> > you come to a split in the mines, one avenue left, one right, and one straight down the center. taking the right pathway for long enough just leads to a cave in. down the center and you can keep walking for hours. the deeper you go, the darker it gets. the one on the left leads to a solid wall, beams of wood and metal stacked up like a barrier in the past, immovable. when black sheep settles a hand against it, they suck in a breath of air, their nails curling into the wood like they want to claw their way inside. “i think there’s something in there. something it wants.” but no matter how they pull or pry or kick, the barricade doesn’t budge. you have discovered the importance of the cave.

> > _the further they walk, the more ominous and unsettled they feel, it seems to affect black sheep more strongly than it does lynx._

# GENERAL SCRIPTS

## SCRIPT ONE (two muse)

> it looks like dried blood on the concrete as the rain starts to fall. and still, muse 1 remains seated on the swing at silent park. red rain is nothing compared to the looming threat of the antler god. when muse 2 sees them, they seem to be… talking to themselves? but they’re looking at the swing next to them. the empty seat seems to swing in rhythm with muse 1, more than makes sense for the wind to be moving it. in fact, as muse 2 looks around the park, it seems like all the equipment is moving and squeaking as if children are playing on it. as if they are not the only two around.

## SCRIPT TWO (anyone)

> the rain falling from the sky still carries with it that ruddy red hue, but the faucets seem back to normal. in their homes and cafe the water runs clear, at least it does in the light. dark enough and it glows a deep indigo, something bioluminescent, like those mushrooms that started multiplying and running rampant through the forest. the forest doesn’t have enough of a hold to leech on and to control, the antler god has found its new sacrifice. but it’s enough to muddle the minds of those it’s owed. in the corner of their eyes, they can see the antler god lurking, can feel the drag of its antlers across their back. the birds continue their cawing until it warps into words. like they’re talking to them. promising death. animals look like they force their way into homes, mutating into bones and back again. their fears manifest and follow them as long as the water courses through their systems. the hallucinations continue for far too long.
>
> _note: marsh, brush, and bat are aware that the water supply has been tampered with._
