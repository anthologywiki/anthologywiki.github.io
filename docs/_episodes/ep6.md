# EP 6: THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB

> inside the town, it feels stifling. it’s hard to explain, it doesn’t make sense. the town should be the same as always. most of the townspeople are acting like it’s the same as always. but it’s not. not to them. plant life seems to be encroaching on the borders, foliage creeping past the pavement in ways that shouldn’t be possible. the birds hang themselves like a cloak around the town and peer down at everyone who walks by, tipping their heads this way and that. it’s hard not to compare them to a surveillance camera. there’s a strange split where everything is simultaneously wrong and not all at once. the humidity is receding, but that doesn’t make it any easier to breathe. living in this town is starting to feel like choking. there’s an undercurrent of something dangerous, something unavoidable. it feels like the calm before the storm, like holding your breath before you jump, like a car wreck made from the bones of their town and all the ancestors that set everything into motion.

# PLOT PROGRESSION SCRIPTS

**main cast:** lamb, stag/doe/forest, snake, dove, angora, cottontail, marsh

## SUBSUME (OPT 1)

**starring:** lamb, stag/doe (whichever one said they would obey the antler god in last episode; if neither did, use the forest script instead)

> stag/doe decide it’s worth it, it’s not like the other sacrifices are in any real danger, right? they seem to be going around town just as well as anyone else is. so, you convince lamb along with you to the clearing that the antler god picked out- the one overgrown with life, a field of flowers with colors so dizzyingly bright that the only image it could possibly invoke is poison. you find the god there, waiting. there’s a slab of rock before it with something carved across the surface. the runes look like antlers. stag/doe clutches tight at lamb’s hand and tells them “it’s okay.” and it will be okay, they’re helping [for stag: the antler god will make the town better, will pull it out from the derelict state it’s fallen into. it’s promised that lamb will be fine.] [for doe: the antler god will help her family. will find a way for the town to prosper, for them to prosper like before. lamb will be fine.] “i knew i could trust you.” the antler god says, and its voice is so deep it rattles the caverns of chests like a peal of thunder. and then there is thunder. an iteration of it, but worse. stag/doe hears the ringing of white noise like an explosion, a collapse back into the overgrown grass. a ritual they’re not allowed to witness.

## SUBSUME (OPT 2)

**starring:** of the forest, lamb (only if stag/doe option not used)

> it spoke into bat’s ear first, that they needed a sixth. elk was against it. anyone could see that, plain as day, that this was a terrible idea. maybe it was because elk wasn’t supposed to be within the fold, could not move with them as if they were one body- a body controlled by the god in the forest. so bat spoke into magpie’s ear, about that sixth, about feeling the need for them deep in their chest, an unavoidable longing. and then magpie mentioned it to lynx, who could feel that need tugging at their limbs like they might’ve been made of putty, adjustable and pliant. lynx held onto elk’s wrist and brought them along, because they needed to be six. they couldn’t afford to lose one. and so it came to be that lamb was among them, but elk’s eyes were a changing thing, filled to the brim with pictures of the past. these avatars of the god seem to speak as one, urging lamb on and into the forest, to the feet of the antler god. it stands in front of a stone slab marked with carvings of runes and antlers in long scratches and they smile back at it with wide, feral smiles. all lamb can see is too many teeth all aimed at their throat.

## REFLECTION

**starring:** snake, dove

> the more that snake has been looking into how the antler god is negatively impacting everyone, the town, the more it feels like they’re being watched. the more birds cackle outside of their window. the more they see the blurry shape of it’s body stalking after them through the streets. the more voices they hear winding out from the forest. at night, snake sees them again. in their home this time, as they’re pulling back the mirrored cabinet of their bathroom. it’s there and gone. shorter than it’s ever stayed before. they find themselves turning over everything they know about the antler god, and eventually end up in front of dove. they [were friends once/are friends depending on current r/s], and they want to convinced them out of the hold the antler god seems to have on them. that and they remember the strong interest that dove held in all of those heirlooms. “look. something isn’t right, you can see that, right? and i think there’s a little more to do with seeing…”

## DISCORD

**starring:** angora, cottontail, marsh

> it’s hard for cottontail to shake what happened with bat out of their head. the order of the rabbits is like a family, and continuing on with the book, with what the antler god is after feels like sending everyone into slaughter. cottontail means to talk to them all, but finds themselves stuck between angora and marsh before anyone else arrives. something uneasy seems to be pooling between them. cottontail reluctant to keep throwing themselves head first into the secrets of the book and marsh, eager to push even further. angora sides with cottontail, and a fight breaks out. on the way out the door, marsh takes the book. nobody notices until it’s too late.

> > you hold the book in your hands, and you can feel the power it contains. the mismatched pages and scratched out words just make it feel more alive. it doesn’t even matter if the antler god was the one who did it in the first place, because it’s been showing them so much past what’s just written there. would anything have happened at all if the antler god hadn’t shown them? no. they’d all still be stuck in the same boring town. this gives them a purpose. it gives you a purpose. one page seems to call to you in particular, and you let it slide open. another ritual, and you let your eyes lose focus as everything shapes into something you make sense of. step one: harvest the mushrooms.

# GENERAL SCRIPTS

## SCRIPT ONE (two muse)

> it’s night, and muse 1 and muse 2 find themselves hiding out in the crow’s nest. half for a drink, and half because they know the owner knows all about birds and the birds sure are acting odd. so they ask, and all they get is an odd look. an “what are you talking about? do i need to cut you off or is this your idea of a bad joke?” he shakes his head at the same time a bird crashes into a nearby window beak-first with an ear-piercing shriek. they look at each other and back to the owner, but he’s still shaking his head and walking away. they’re sure that’s not normal bird behavior. they decide to get some footage or the birds behaving badly. though, this seems to put a target on their backs as the birds chatter to each other and hop closer and closer. close enough that they notice their eyes are so white they look like pearls. they bring the footage back to the owner, but he just rolls his eyes and cuts them off. “it’s a bird. it’s squawking. that’s what birds do.”

## SCRIPT TWO (two muse)

> it’s suffocating in town. the crows are everywhere, watching. most townsfolk don’t seem to notice the foliage, the fungi, anything, and it’s frustrating. so muse 3 and muse 4 decide to leave. well, not really, because whenever they reach the bridge they can’t bring themselves to cross the threshold. so they go to the forest instead, at least here the foliage makes sense and is easier to ignore, pretend everything is okay. before they know it, they end up at the wishing well. they could both use a miracle right now, so muse 3 goes first despite the stories of wishes being granted in the most literal, unhelpful way possible. they toss in a coin after making their wish, and for a second nothing happens. then, the wind picks up. the ground trembles beneath their feet, lightly but unmistakably so. they know they must get out of there. soon.

## SCRIPT THREE (anyone)

> things around town are turning, in the way that milk turns. something sour. things in the town are slowly changing to match the landscape that the antler god is ushering in. it’s hard to notice at first, because of how slow moving it is. the taxidermied birds lining the walls of the crow’s nest have the same pale, milky eyes as the rest of the animals around town. the door to mija’s place is opening on the left instead of the right and…it wasn’t like that before, was it? in lee’s hardware store it seems like the sections are all mixed up, a variety of bones and wood carving interspersed between the nails and bolts. things are different, aren’t they? cat is sure they are. at least for a select few.
