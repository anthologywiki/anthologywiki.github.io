# EP 8: FOLLOW THE THREAD

> the town closes in around them the more they discover. onyang was promised destruction, only, they never agreed to it, this six year generation. the forest looms around the town, and some swear it looks bigger than before, denser. the cold air creeps in through the cracks and wind howls from between the trees. they sound like layered voices of everyone forgotten. loved ones of the past, and loved ones of the present, even if whoever is hearing it knows they’re still alive and sitting in town. the antler god is calling like a promise, the inevitability of their place as a sacrifice or as a willing follower.

# PLOT PROGRESSION SCRIPTS

**main cast:** marsh, brush, hare, fox, starling, stag, magpie, snake, cat

## BLACKOUT

**starring:** marsh, brush, hare

> the thing is, the book calls for four people to complete the ritual. this was fine in the past when they had everyone in the order of the rabbits, but now it’s just marsh and brush. and that’s probably the only reason why marsh stopped to listen when hare came calling. talking about how cottontail really overstepped and just how could they all stop using the book when it had given them so much? for hare this wasn’t true, this was the plan they’d divised with fox. for marsh, who needed another body for the ritual, they were more willing to believe them, even when brush professed doubt. it’s hare’s intention to grab the book before they start the ritual. only, when they reach the mouth of the cave and lay down a circle of those mushrooms to stand in the middle of, it’s like they can’t leave. so the ritual starts in the dead of night, everything dark with flashes of color and words that don’t make sense hanging in the air. the ritual, marsh had told them, would break open the throat to the cave. but there’s not enough people, and hare isn’t truly devoted. the foundation of the town shakes as a crack snakes down the barricaded wall deep in the cave. in town, the lights in every building and streetlight flicker in varying lengths: short. pause. short, long, short. pause. short, long. pause. short, long, long, short. pause. short, long, short. pause. short, long, short, short. pause. short, long, short, short. pause. short, short, short. stop. and then all the lights in the town go dark. while marsh investigates, hare takes the book and runs.

## PUZZLE

**starring:** fox, starling

> hare came back with the book and shared their findings with fox. inside, they found a page, a drawing with a pocketwatch drawn on one side and the top half of a door. they decide to wander through town, trying to match the door in the picture with anything that might look even vaguely similar. and that’s when starling sees them, sees the page in their hands. they stop them, talk, and fit the two pages together like two halves of a puzzle. the image becomes apparent, a decorated door with a heart drawn square in the middle, a pocketwatch and knife sketched on either side of it. “hare said the antler god wanted something in that cave. behind some large barricade, not a door though. do you think it’s their heart?” fox asks out, and starling finds themselves nodding. thinks back to daesan temple, the the tunnels they walked through, sprawling and without end. but not blocked behind any barricade. maybe there’s a way through them, to find that door.

> > you come across the door from the picture. it looks like a mashup of carved stone and wood. you both push against it, but it refuses to budge. the holes indented into the door look more like strange keyholes than a decoration, but you’re not entirely sure what to fit inside. your hands and the stones nearby don’t seem to make any difference. in the middle is a crude carving of a heart, one that’s not anatomically correct. instead it sits, like a foreboding valentine.

## CUTTHROAT

**starring:** stag, magpie

> there’s enough discordant muttering born from the antler god’s mouthpiece that magpie can piece together that the antler god is looking for those heirlooms. it’s like being caught in a vice, each side pulling them apart - of following what the antler god wants of them, and of fighting against it and trying to reclaim their own autonomy. but approaching stag and asking outright about that old heirloom, the knife could be following either path. “here’s what i saw, on some old book page. i think it’s important.” magpie tells him as they sit down and sketch it out, the same wobbly knife in the corner. “i think we can use it against it. do you still have it?” and he did, once. magpie knows that in the same way all the sacrifices seem to know too much. more than they want to.

## SEEING DOUBLE

**starring:** snake, cat

> the more that snake has been dealing with nightmares and hallucinations, the more they think about mirrors. about their mirror, their old heirloom. hitting something of a dead end, they find themselves approaching cat who has always seemed so wary about the antler god, about what’s been happening around town, about how they noticed first that it didn’t affect everyone. and they pose their theory on the mirrors. “well, let’s test it.” cat decides, and they find one of those old taxidermied birds in the crow’s nest to hold a mirror up to, in its reflection the bird looks normal. no milk-white eyes, no knife-sharp beak. “it undoes the…unreality. kind of.” cat decides, and snake tells them about the strange mirror of their past. and they both wonder if it can be used as a deterrent, something the antler god will balk at.

# GENERAL SCRIPTS

**open to anyone**

> it’s late, but not late enough for everyone to be asleep. that’s why so many people notice the flickering of lights around them in jagged intervals. short. pause. short, long, short. pause. short, long. pause. short, long, long, short. pause. short, long, short. pause. short, long, short, short. pause. short, long, short, short. pause. short, short, short. stop. and then everything electrical in the town abruptly shuts off. cellphones might have a charge left, but they refuse to connect to any sort of signal. outside, it seems as if a blanket has fallen over the sky, snuffing out stars and blocking clouds in a single slab of impossible, inky black. maybe there’s something out there in the dark. maybe there’s something inside. maybe there’s nowhere left in town that’s safe anymore.
