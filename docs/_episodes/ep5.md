# EP 5: BLOOD RUNS THICKER THAN WATER

> the river runs blood red into town, thick and clotting. the animals are starting to retreat. their eyes are as white as bone and they stagger around like their limbs are disjointed. some have fungi sprouting up along their backs. the sun forgets to wake up. during the day it hides behind the clouds that have overcome the sky. the town seems stuck in an eternal wash of dim gray to black, like it’s stuck in a movie before the invention of color grading. the bridge is rebuilt, but the rush of red water running rapid-fast underneath it feels like a warning. do not cross. down by the creek of it and anyone can see that it’s water still, just drowning in a mud-red silt. it smells metallic, like rusted iron.

# PLOT PROGRESSION SCRIPTS

**main cast:** elk, lamb, fox, hare, cat, snake, fieldmouse, lynx, starling, magpie, cottontail, bat, stag, doe

## INHERITENCE

**starring:** elk, lamb

> elk is having another vision. the kind that makes their head spin, like a bout of vertigo. they slide to the side and prop themselves up against the wall as they watch images scurry around in their head. they’re seeing the past again, far back. elk watches as someone forges together a ring, pours blood from a stopper down to trap it in a pool of amber. “for protection.” they say, as they hand it to someone nearby. “for protection” they repeat as they hand it down to their next of kin. on and on it goes until it stops in modernity. you watch as it’s finally handed off to lamb. they’re not sure why you’re being shown this, but then elk sees…it. clearer than they ever have before, the antler god. it snarls in a way that a deer head shouldn’t be able to and charges. elk feels themselves get hit back by a force so strong they wonder if their ribs have cracked, and they blink up from their back where they’re sprawled out on the ground in reality. their chest is sore, and they yank down the collar of their shirt enough to see a large bruise blooming along their sternum. it looks suspiciously similar to the shape of two antlers. elk realizes then that they weren’t meant to see that. that it was angry at them. for whatever reason, it doesn’t want lamb to have that ring. for exactly that reason, elk wants to help get it back to them.

## FABLE

**starring:** fox, hare

> fox has been noticing the order of the rabbits more and more lately. the way they exchange glances and laugh like they’re talking, but their lips never move. the way cottontail always has that strange book hugged tight to their chest. the way they all walk in step, like they might be one person. and recently, it seems like hare has been getting closer to them, too. fox doesn’t trust them. doesn’t trust what they’ll do to hare. so they send them a message, propose a meetup. and now the fox and the hare sit, like the start of a fable. only in this one, the fox wants to conscript hare’s help to take down the entire warren. to figure out what’s so special about that book.

## DISTORTION

**starring:** cat, snake

> the gory wash of the river is unsettling, cat thinks. they even inched down to the river’s edge to see if it might’ve actually been blood. it wasn’t, but it still seemed…off. and then they went across the bridge, or they meant to. before they remembered they left their umbrella at home and they needed to be picked up before it rained. the more cat explored though, the more they realized something. not everyone in the town was reacting to the strange river, or the animals circling overhead with their opaque eyes and cackle-calls. no, some people’s eyes glazed right over these oddities like they couldn’t recognize them. cat’s worried they’re starting to go mad when they find themselves running into snake. in their panic, they ask “you can see it right - that?” and point to the trail of mushrooms leading toward the river bank, the red slowly seems to be leaching up their stalks, coloring them a burnt orange. “yeah? i mean. they’re everywhere.” cat swallows and shakes their head, “i don’t think everyone can see them. and i don’t think we can leave.”

## CONSUME

**starring: fieldmouse, lynx**

> fieldmouse has been feeling…off. different. not themselves. in fact, they feel like there might be ten of themselves. or twenty. they feel themselves lurching in tandem with the rabbits hopping in sad circles on bent legs. they shudder with the birds as they clatter into each other and squawk out from the trees. they wake themselves up with a guttural growl from their dream as a dog attacking a farmer. when they climb out of bed, they still taste blood on their tongue, the tang of pennies that they can’t scrape free with just the flat of their teeth. they pretend their room isn’t covered in fungi. they pretend the pattern of them hasn’t bloomed across their skin. they pretend they don’t notice the pale way their eyes shine in the moonlight. they pretend they haven’t been walking into the woods and pausing at the deep basin of the river, of submerging themselves and giving their lifeforce to the forest. because fieldmouse can hear it calling to them. it’s on a slow-moving walk back into the forest that lynx finds fieldmouse. they’re similar, almost. but by now lynx knows the truth. that it’s trying to use fieldmouse as it’s fifth sacrifice, as it’s soul. that they’ll break them apart in an attempt to yank it out from them. even lynx can see that this won’t work. but maybe that story from elk can help them…with the flowers at the grave site, how they weakened the antler god’s power. how maybe they can weaken it’s hold, too.
>
> _lynx convinces fieldmouse to the top of the mountain to ingest some of the flowers. while this will make fieldmouse sick, it will slowly release the control the antler god has on them, as well as the sleepwalking and connection to other controlled animals. it is up to the fieldmouse’s discretion whether they take some back to keep consuming/use as a sample in their research._

## MIMIC

**starring:** starling, magpie

> this is the…well, starling has stopped counting how many times this week they’ve loaded back into that website they were given. it started with another recording…another recording of their own voice. a voice of themselves ruminating over where they kept that old heirloom book before they sold it. it’s not them, it can’t be, because starling doesn’t give a fuck about that old book. but this website-version of themselves sure seems to care a whole lot. they turn to investigating, putting their degree to some use. not that they’re making much headway past figuring out people are hearing strange voices around town, that some are linked back to tapes. tapes of starling. tapes that they couldn’t have made…right? starling almost thinks of getting rid of their phone and their anchor to that website when magpie appears in front of them like the world’s strangest coincidence, parroting back that same phrase starling has heard in their own voice, by now too many times to count, “hey, you used to own some old vintage book, right? where did you keep it before you sold it.” magpie’s face doesn’t seem to match the aggressive interest found in their tone. starling feels a shiver drip down their spine.
>
> _your characters are welcome to puzzle out that magpie is not the one actually interested and try to get to the bottom of the mysterious book inquiry if you so desire_
>
> #### **REPLY TO THEIR THREAD IF THEY RETURN TO WHERE THE BOOK WAS KEPT**
>
> > you both sort through boxes trying to unearth whatever it is that the antler god is after. you find scrapbooks filled with baby pictures, old schoolwork, cluttered paperwork, old tax documents, and eventually some early true crime books that used to live on the shelves of starling’s childhood bedroom. while thumbing through one, a ripped page falls out. it looks old. like it came from the very vintage book that starling didn’t care about. it’s ripped in half though, and there’s a blocky picture of what might be…a rectangle? with two slots fit in like holes, and a sketch of a knife in the corner. “what do you think it wants with this?” starling asks. “burn it.” magpie replies, almost too fast. they know that if the antler god could control more than magpie’s mouth, it’d have reached out and taken it by now. “leave.” magpie grits out instead, fighting the antler god’s words in their mouth, one arm raised like a barrier between them and the page as they sink their teeth into the back of their own hand, the antler god’s punishment.

## FAMILY TREE

**starring:** cottontail, bat

> cottontail is hiding something’ the antler god whispers into the bat’s ear one night. it doesn’t know what, of that bat is sure. it just feels that something is off, the way it can feel so very much about everything it’s connected to. ‘find out what it is.’ and bat isn’t sure of what it is, or why the antler god cares. but by now, bat knows what will happen if they don’t listen to the antler god in the way it wants to be listened to. so bat finds themselves in the middle of cottontail’s home, sorting through their belongings until they come across an old page, a family tree. suddenly bat knows what the antler god is after, because lamb’s connected, or, maybe could be connected. but before bat has time to leave, cottontail is pushing their way inside and they stand across from each other, the antler god laughing in bat’s ear, followed by a a whisper about cottontail.
>
> _cottontail’s mun should inform bat of a secret about their muse (it could be anything they’ve been up to that the antler god knows, something about their past, or even a fear), as the antler god is trying to get into their head about keeping secrets._

## HEAVY LIES THE CROWN

**starring:** stag, doe

> stag and doe move through the forest and into a clearing. in the middle there’s a pile of branches hefted into the approximate shape of a throne. on its seat rests a crown, or something like one. horns just up and around it, a ring of spiked antlers. stag smiles and steps ahead of doe like this is their birthright. like this is what they’re meant to inherit - the mantle of the antler god. doe catches them by the shoulder and yanks back hard, impossible hard. the sky above them cracks and purple bleeds into the blue above them. they’re dreaming, they realize, as they watch the large shape of the antler god settle behind its odd throne. “there is a special place for one. the one who will do anything for me. the one who won’t let anything get in the way, not even yourself.” doe swears they watch it tilt its head toward stag. a quiet affirmation that they can’t handle it, whatever they’re meant to do. “show me who should wear my crown.” it’s jaw distends down into what must be a smile, but all that appears are rows and rows and rows of so many teeth railroad spiked down into its mandible. “because…i need more. do you know that i was promised six sacrifices to do as i pleased with? and i was only given five. i need another. but i’ve learned, recently. i have an option.” it comes closer, a descent of bones collapsing in on themselves as it bends to look them both in the eyes. “a little lamb. you’ll deliver it to me, won’t you?” it smiles again, and the smell of decay and rot and all things dead surround them like a cage. the dream tears itself apart, and they both wake simultaneously. they swear they can feel the weight of that crown on their heads.

> _please make sure to send your muse’s answer on whether or not they will help to the antler god’s account, your muses do not need to be in agreement_

# GENERAL SCRIPTS

**all are two muse scripts**

## SCRIPT ONE

> muse 1 and muse 2 are outside of town. it’s not the smartest idea they’ve had, but just sitting and waiting doesn’t feel right either. they have enough sense to leave the river behind them though, opting to hike into the mountains instead. by the time they reach daesan temple they’re sore enough to find refuge inside, it feels like a silly story now, the temple being haunted, after so many horrible things are happening around town. they crack open water bottles and listen to the howling of the wind. and then they listen to something join the wind. it’s hard to pick apart at first, the voice. “you should find them. those items. you should find them and get rid of them. you’ll regret it if you don’t. i’ll make you regret it.” the voice sounds…almost familiar, but it’s too slurred to discern who it is exactly. like they forgot how to speak and were taught again in only a day. it loops around like a record. they both climb to their feet and poke around the temple, but they can’t find that voice, or any items that it spoke of.

## SCRIPT TWO

> muse 3 and muse 4 are at the cafe, hoping caffeine will overcompensate on solving at least some of their problems. they’re the only ones there aside from a bored, vacant looking employee. they order their drinks, a classic americano. and that’s the reason that they don’t realize filtered water isn’t being used, the espresso colors everything dark and indiscernible. it’s hard to make out the murky red that the water of the town has taken on. so they drink. it’s hard to notice at first, the effects. that they’re hallucinating. that whatever has leeched into the water has a greater effect than a simple color change.
