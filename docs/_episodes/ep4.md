# EP 4: THE GOOD BOOK SAYS

> everyone seems to be on edge. there’s tension in the air. not like before, when it started, when it tasted like electricity. now it’s like the weight of a knife pressed to a throat. imminent. terrifying. above the town, the sky starts to glow purple-blue. the mushrooms climbing the edges of buildings and leading their pathway back to the forest pulse in time with it. like they’re communicating. but that doesn’t make any sense, they’re just plants. through the town, animals wander. animals that shouldn’t be there. rabbits with eyes that look like clouds bound in jagged leaps between the cars. birds swoop in with their cackle-shrieks. one slams into the glass window of a storefront, lays dead for a moment, then picks itself back up and flies off again, leaving an imprint in its wake. the near-wild farm dogs on the outskirts of town growl deep and bare their spit-slicked teeth at anyone who passes, like the owners of the land itself are the trespassers.

# PLOT PROGRESSION SCRIPTS

**main cast:** cottontail, marsh, fieldmouse, stag, snake, doe, brush, angora, hare, bat, magpie, elk, lynx

## FINE PRINT

**starring:** cottontail, marsh

> cottontail and marsh both haven’t felt the call of a ritual recently, and it makes their skin itch. cottontail is sure there’s a reason, and marsh thinks the reason is that cottontail isn’t trying hard enough. it feels almost like the past, when they would get into petty squabbles. but surely they can find a reasonable solution to this. they both end up deep in the back of the library, combing through the book’s pages and reference volumes to see if there’s any rhyme or reason to the strange runes printed within.
>
> COTTONTAIL FINDS: in the back of an old book, folded up eight times and nearly crumbling between their fingers, an old…family tree? there are five portraits on top traced down through the generations. it doesn’t span to the present, but you haul out another few books and are able to map out that the families all trace back to bat, magpie, elk, and lynx. one family seems to have died off, but their closest relative left alive seems to be…lamb.
>
> MARSH FINDS: nothing in the library. annoyed, you leave cottontail to their book scouring and push your way into lee’s hardware. maybe something in the back of the shop could be useful. it’s between the old vinyls of bands that nobody has heard before (that you aren’t sure even exist) that you find it. an old, weathered page, just like in the book. it looks like it was torn out and shoved back there. you greedily take in the page. it’s ripped in half, diagonally - but it looks to be a sketch of a door. there are two open slots…keyholes? and a picture that was ripped clean through at the center. it almost looks like it was meant to be an anatomical heart. on the edges of the page, there’s a sketch of an old pocketwatch. odd. you pocket the page and don’t tell cottontail about it. not yet.

## HIVEMIND

**starring:** fieldmouse, stag

> stag wakes up in bed and can’t move. they’ve heard about this. sleep paralysis. there’s a demon at the foot of their bed. that’s usually what people see, right? demons. it makes a guttural groaning noise and shudders. or tries to. as stag’s eyes adjust to the darkness, they notice that the body is streaked with mud, and that their eyes have a film of white across the entirety of them. they’d scream, but they can’t. the more stag studies the body, the more they realize who it is underneath all of that mud. fieldmouse. stag watches as fieldmouse lurches around the bedroom like they’re in search of something. slowly they turn to stag. they look off balance. “knife?” fieldmouse asks, the word slurred. stag feels their joints unlock, and they slide quick out of bed to grab fieldmouse’s shoulders and shake them awake.. by the time they blink the white from their eyes, they look scared.

## CUNNING

**starring:** snake, doe

> lately it seems that stag has been too trusting of the antler god. they act like they’re some chosen one. snake and doe can both see it, though they dislike it for their own private reasons. snake doesn’t trust the antler god at all. they saw the wound it left on ?? after it met them in the woods. they want to get rid of it. doe has only listened to its words promising power. they remember the ill-fortune their family has run into. their parents debt. what if it could fix it? what if it could lift them up and out of the rut they’ve fallen into. stag already has enough. they both get to talking, about how stag shouldn’t be trusted. not entirely. they might have opposing reasons for their distrust, but they don’t divulge that part. they forge a partnership, only, without the trust.

## WARREN

**starring:** brush, angora, hare

> cottontail and marsh have been busy, the strongest personalities in your order gone. maybe that’s the reason why brush and angora reach out to hare who has been skirting the sidelines of their group for a while now. sneaking in and out of the boundary line without assimilating completely. and that’s what it is, assimilating. because you can make each other’s thoughts fog up in the other’s heads if you want to. you can talk without opening your mouths. you watch as people point strange looks at you as you cackle at jokes unspoken. but hare doesn’t get it. they’ve never quite gotten it, not since they’ve left. so brush and angora try and make them get it, in the now. “it’s like this. the book tells us what to do, and then things happen. powerful things. good things.” brush explains and ignores the slightly worried expression on angora’s face. “it started with the berries. it must have.” angora adds on after a beat.
>
> SUBMIT TO HARE IF THEY EAT MORE BERRIES:
> you feel dizzy for a moment. wrong. like you’re not yourself anymore. not completely. it’s not the same for you as it was for them. you were always an other. never quite a rabbit. but swallowing down the acidic tang of berries makes it feel like you’re forcing yourself into a box you can’t fit in. it almost feels like a lid is being lowered down over your head. and then, you hear them. brush and angora. only, their mouths aren’t moving. but their voices still swim between your ears. did it work? angora wonders out, and you nod. they smile at you, a feral happiness. you ignore the queasy unease lapping your stomach and try to match their expression.
>
> you now have the ability to communicate without speaking only to the order of the rabbits for short durations of time.

## INTO THE WOODS

**starring:** of the forest

> you’ve always been drawn together by virtue of being sidelined by the town. like it was hard-baked into your dna. and one day, it’s into the woods. magpie and bat are there first, perched on a fallen tree. lynx after, with a dazed look in their eyes, elk in tow. it takes a moment for lynx to shake their way out of their stupor, for elk to suggest leaving the woods, for bat to clamp their hands over their ears with a shriek that makes everyone pause. and then magpie starts talking in that voice that isn’t quite their own: “you are an extension of me. you are nothing without me. you are bound together. you are stronger in the forest.” magpie’s head swivels to look at elk, and their expression doesn’t match their face. like they don’t want to continue talking. “that’s why your head hurts so much. because you stay out of the forest. because you stay away from me. because you’re scared.” magpie clenches their jaw, a refusal to keep talking, and that’s when they bite down on their lip hard enough to draw blood instead. “it wants us to do as we’re told.” bat repeats the words echoing in their ears before they speak them aloud. “or we’ll make it angry.” everyone looks toward magpie, blood still dripping down their face. “there’s something we have to find.” elk reaches out to steady themselves on a nearby tree, and then they double in half with a gasp. a fractured vision scratches across their eyes with a burn, gritty like sand across the sclera. “there’s a fifth. or, there should be a fifth.” and out from elk tumbles the story of old with more details than the antler god wanted them to see. a story that ended with the antler god wound up in those flowers growing up and around its grave. bound and paralyzed.
>
> all muses in the of the forest group are now aware of the history that led them to their strange connection with the antler god - their long-distant relatives sacrificing their blood and bloodline to the creature, and that it’s missing its fifth.

# GENERAL SCRIPTS

**open to anyone**

> maybe it was a mistake to throw a sort-of party in the factory square. all muses know things are more than off at the moment, but that just made everyone want to do something to help unwind. it’s not good to keep living like this. so tense. so worried. so everyone just wanted to drink a little. relax. joke around. and that’s what they started out doing. maybe they played some darts, tagged the building, took stupid pictures, downed a case of beer. by the time the animals start circling the building and leering in the windows, it’s the dead of night. their eyes flash an angry violet in the glow of flashlights as everyone shines them out. there’s something large at the door, and growling deep. like a dog. like a wolf. everyone freezes and listens to the sound of birds pelting themselves against the windows. picking themselves up, doing it again. and again, until their beaks crack fissures into the weakened glass. everyone needs to leave. or hide. or something. suddenly, getting drunk doesn’t seem like it was a bright idea.
