# EP 1: WELCOME HOME

> the town sits still, like always. there’s a damp heat in the air, the kind that breeds mosquitos hungry for blood. the town’s center is as lively as it ever was (that is to say, the same way someone might call a fifteen-year-old dog playing fetch lively). it was a sight akin to that once in a while spur of motion before the joints remember to be tired again. it’s nestled at that end point of spring where everything’s already woken itself up from the winter. it’s a normal start to summer in onyang, or it should be; but that doesn’t explain the electric charge in the air. it almost feels like a storm’s coming, only for weeks now, hairs standing up on end and vibrating with static. there’s the feeling of something powerful, of waiting, of holding your breath. but to the naked eye, all around town it’s just the sawing of cicadas and humidity. a normal summer. welcome home.

THE ANTLER GOD ENTERS YOUR DREAM —
<br/>
at night the cool air still seeps in through the cracks of your window. it’s calming, and it lulls you into a complacent sleep. it’s a silent oblivion until  it isn’t. there’s a creature climbing out from the black behind your eyelids. it wears a skull like a head, hollowed out eyes and antlers that grow longer the more you stare at them. it clacks its jaws like a marionette, teeth cartwheeling around in its face. the snapping grows louder and louder, until it’s deafening, until you’re sure you should be waking up, but you don’t. you just start to recognize that the clacking is rearranging into words as it remembers to speak.
<br/><br/>
“bring me your most valuable possession and i will reward you. leave it at the mouth of the forest, under the tree with eyes. help to pull me from my grave and follow in my footsteps.” 
<br/><br/>
you wake with a start, heart pounding so hard in your chest you can feel it beat against your sternum, like a bruise from the inside out. the creature’s words still ring in your ears. you won’t forget them.

THE ANTLER GOD ENTERS YOUR DREAM —
<br/>
you can hear the sawing of cicadas outside, grinding still air into fervent noise. it sings you to sleep. now you’re in a meadow that’s buzzing with that same seesaw of noise. there’s fireflies, too many, more than should exist. you wade through them. the deeper you wade, the less they look like fireflies. the pale butter-yellow glow they give off flickers into a deep red. they flash all around you, a discordant sos signal. the sawing grows louder. it surrounds you, invades your senses, until you crouch in the middle of this dream world, your hands over your ears. 
<br><br>
“bring me your most valuable possession and i will reward you. leave it at the mouth of the forest, under the tree with eyes and i will help lead your family from their misfortunes. follow me into a future.”
<br><br>
you wake, and it should be to the sound of the cicadas, but they’re gone. it’s silent all around you in a way that’s unnatural. no bugs or animals or even the howl of the wind. it’s so quiet you can hear the echo of what it said. you won’t forget it.

a floorboard creaks, but there’s nobody walking around to make the noise. the creaking moves closer, and closer, until it’s standing right next to your bed. you open your eyes, and everything is wrong. your bed is in the middle of the forest and there is a looming creature standing above you. its skull leers down, and the ropes of shed velvet from its antlers sway in the breeze. this is a dream, you realize, after you try to count the number of fingers you have on one hand and end up with six instead of five. you look up at the creature, sure now that it can’t hurt you; not trapped in your head like this.
<br/><br>
“bring me your most valuable possession and i will reward you. leave it at the mouth of the forest, under the tree with eyes and you will feel fulfillment greater than anything promised to you before.”
<br/><br>
it smiles and somehow the expression pulls past the long curve of its jaw. it smiles wider and wider, until you notice that its teeth aren’t the squared off molars of a deer meant for grinding up grass. they’re long and sharp. when it laughs, it sounds like a scream. or, no. that’s you. you’re screaming. you’re waking yourself up with it in the balmy hold of night. you won’t forget it.

THE ANTLER GOD ENTERS YOUR DREAM —
<br/>
on your nightstand, you have the mirror your family gave you, propped up and easy to see. you’re used to your face, the tired features that the night invites. but this time, when you look into the glass, it isn’t yourself that you see. your face is an empty shell of a thing; devoid of a nose or a mouth or eyes. you’re not sure how you’re seeing anything with no eyes (where are your eyes?), but you are. and so you can watch as your face changes. the skin melts and drips to the floor and a skull emerges, horns sprouting from the top and your not-eyes start to burn as you take in its image. you wrench your impossible gaze away from the mirror and suddenly that same skull is in front of you instead of inside you.
<br/><br/>
“bring me your most valuable possession and i will reward you. leave it at the mouth of the forest, under the tree with eyes. follow me, and find the truth.”
<br/><br/>
you look back to the mirror and you’re wearing your face again. you hear yourself breathing too fast, feel your feet tangled in your sheets. you’re awake, but you still feel its presence in the dark. you won’t forget it.

<br/>
THE ANTLER GOD ENTERS YOUR DREAM —
<br/>
outside, a wind chime scatters into a discordant melody. by now you’re used to it. like white noise, it helps you fall asleep. the chiming continues, even in your dream. ahead, in the forest of your mind, you see a stag. it looks like it’s from the prehistoric times with how it towers high among the trees. you crane your head back to look up at its face- or, at what should be its face. the meat of it has been worn down and all that remains is a skull, a limpid ivory in the moonlight. its jaw cracks like a tree collapsing as it starts to speak. its voice so resonant you feel the ground shake underneath your feet.
<br/>
<br/>
“i have a task for you. follow me and we will all find our way to greatness. bring with you your most valuable possession and make your way into the mouth of the woods. find the tree with eyes and gather everything you have found at its base. bring it up the mountain, to the high peak, and leave everything below the inscribed tree. give me my offerings and i will give you power in exchange.”
<br/>
<br/>
while it speaks, its body changes. now it has hands, and it reaches out to offer you one. you take it, and it guides you into the forest and high up the mountain. you both stop in front of the strange tree it spoke of. you look up at it and watch as lightning snakes down from the sky and splits it down the middle. it blinds you, and when you open your eyes, you’re awake in your bed.

<summary><strong>FOLLOW UP - IF THEY GAVE THE HEIRLOOM</strong></summary>
<br/>
the antler god visits you in your dreams once more, it’s wearing a smile. it means to look reassuring, surely. it just hasn’t gotten used to its face yet. it doesn’t know the long shape of its own jaw. its sharp teeth saw together as it speaks. “you have proven yourself useful. you have proven yourself better than your ancestors of old. i keep my promises, i grant you a boon.”
<br/><br/>
<em>your muse has a bout of good fortune for one in-character week. they might: find money on the floor, a bill may have been sent in error, if they were ill then they might get better, they suddenly get a promotion. however, the good luck should only surround the character themselves and not be overreaching</em>

<summary><strong>FOLLOW UP - IF THEY DID NOT GIVE THE HEIRLOOM</strong></summary>
<br/>
the antler god visits you in your dreams once more. or, no-that’s not right. it’s easy to see right away that this is not a dream, but a nightmare. the forest grows around you like a cage, bears and foxes snarling from behind the branches, salivating so heavily it drips down their jaws as they snap their teeth. from the trees, the crows cackle. the antler god stands before you, larger than the last time you saw it. “you have disobeyed me. you have strayed from your purpose. but i will teach you that it’s easier to fall into step than to turn against me. the past isn’t something worth repeating. i will give you another chance, bring me your most valuable possession, what your family passed down to you, to the tree with eyes.” the antler god disappears, and the animals descend upon you, teeth first.
<br/><br/>
<em>you muse has a bout of bad luck for one in-character day. they might: step in puddle, trip and skin their knee, get a demotion at their job, lose money, etc. </em>

<summary><strong>STAG</strong></summary>
<br/>
YOU WAKE UP SORE AND COVERED IN DIRT — <br/>
this isn’t new. you don’t always make it home again before you wake up, but this time you did. your hands and arms ache, and your joints are stiff. mud is caked underneath your nails. it’s all over, streaked in your hair and inside of your socks. it’s not the rich brown of the earth, but a clay-red that gleams in the sun. dirt is scattered across your bed. you don’t know what you did, but you know where you went. somewhere in the woods. it’s always the woods.<br/><br/>
DO YOU…<br/>
<strong>ignore it</strong>: nothing happens<br/>
<details>
<summary><strong>go back into the woods during the day:</strong></summary>
<br/>
your body starts to relax, the same way it always does when you get this deep in the woods. if only your mind would do the same. it buzzes with the warnings your grandmother used to tell you, which you refuse to heed, even if if you’re not conscious for the transgressions. you are for this one though and that makes you feel worse. you’ve been walking for at least two hours when you start noticing the change in earth. the higher up you go, the more it changes into that clay-red you buried your bed in. in your chest your heart beats inexplicably faster.
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>DO YOU…<br>
>head home: nothing happens<br>
>continue on:<br><br/>
you climb higher up the mountain, for long enough that you start wishing you brought a water bottle. finally, you reach your destination. you can tell it’s your destination because there’s a hole in the ground with piles of dirt all around it, looking like a meteor struck it from the inside out. there’s a tree standing guard above it, the bark tinged black from a burn, a crack running down the middle. you creep closer, and your heart picks up in time with you. at the edge of the hole, you peer down. inside is a coffin stood up vertically, the dirt packed down around the bottom shows it was buried that way. the lid is sealed shut by an uneven line of nails that look rusted. there are ribbons of cut up flowers ringing the box like a decoration. or, no, not a box. a coffin buried wrong. you feel a shiver drag down your spine like ice despite the heat. something in you tells you to leave, to run. but there’s another piece, the part that you hide away that feels strangely…at home. you move in closer, ignoring the dirt now lodged inside of your shoes. you swear you can hear the light scratching of something coming from inside the coffin.</blockquote>

<summary><strong>bottle up some of the dirt and check in with one of the ginseng farmers to ask if they notice anything special about it:</strong></summary>
<br/>
you head through town and toward the farmlands. a lot of them work with the soil, they must know more about it than you do. after getting passed around to a few people, you end up with a man who nods knowingly at the empty jam jar you swept the dirt into. “up higher in the mountains i’d say. the higher you go, the redder it gets. i wouldn’t go up there if i were you, though. lots of snakes. lots of poison ivy. that’s what my mother used to say, anyway.”<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
DO YOU…<br/>
<strong>heed the farmer’s warning and stay in town</strong>: nothing happens
<strong>travel through the woods and up the mountain</strong>:<br/>
