# EP 1: WELCOME HOME

> the town sits still, like always. there’s a damp heat in the air, the kind that breeds mosquitos hungry for blood. the town’s center is as lively as it ever was (that is to say, the same way someone might call a fifteen-year-old dog playing fetch lively). it was a sight akin to that once in a while spur of motion before the joints remember to be tired again. it’s nestled at that end point of spring where everything’s already woken itself up from the winter. it’s a normal start to summer in onyang, or it should be; but that doesn’t explain the electric charge in the air. it almost feels like a storm’s coming, only for weeks now, hairs standing up on end and vibrating with static. there’s the feeling of something powerful, of waiting, of holding your breath. but to the naked eye, all around town it’s just the sawing of cicadas and humidity. a normal summer. welcome home.

# SUBMITS

## OLD GOD'S FLOCK

### STAG

> THE ANTLER GOD ENTERS YOUR DREAM —
> at night the cool air still seeps in through the cracks of your window. it’s calming, and it lulls you into a complacent sleep. it’s a silent oblivion until it isn’t. there’s a creature climbing out from the black behind your eyelids. it wears a skull like a head, hollowed out eyes and antlers that grow longer the more you stare at them. it clacks its jaws like a marionette, teeth cartwheeling around in its face. the snapping grows louder and louder, until it’s deafening, until you’re sure you should be waking up, but you don’t. you just start to recognize that the clacking is rearranging into words as it remembers to speak.
>
> “bring me your most valuable possession and i will reward you. leave it at the mouth of the forest, under the tree with eyes. help to pull me from my grave and follow in my footsteps.”
>
> you wake with a start, heart pounding so hard in your chest you can feel it beat against your sternum, like a bruise from the inside out. the creature’s words still ring in your ears. you won’t forget them.

### DOE

> THE ANTLER GOD ENTERS YOUR DREAM —
> you can hear the sawing of cicadas outside, grinding still air into fervent noise. it sings you to sleep. now you’re in a meadow that’s buzzing with that same seesaw of noise. there’s fireflies, too many, more than should exist. you wade through them. the deeper you wade, the less they look like fireflies. the pale butter-yellow glow they give off flickers into a deep red. they flash all around you, a discordant sos signal. the sawing grows louder. it surrounds you, invades your senses, until you crouch in the middle of this dream world, your hands over your ears.
>
> “bring me your most valuable possession and i will reward you. leave it at the mouth of the forest, under the tree with eyes and i will help lead your family from their misfortunes. follow me into a future.”
>
> you wake, and it should be to the sound of the cicadas, but they’re gone. it’s silent all around you in a way that’s unnatural. no bugs or animals or even the howl of the wind. it’s so quiet you can hear the echo of what it said. you won’t forget it.

### LAMB

> THE ANTLER GOD ENTERS YOUR DREAM —
>
> a floorboard creaks, but there’s nobody walking around to make the noise. the creaking moves closer, and closer, until it’s standing right next to your bed. you open your eyes, and everything is wrong. your bed is in the middle of the forest and there is a looming creature standing above you. its skull leers down, and the ropes of shed velvet from its antlers sway in the breeze. this is a dream, you realize, after you try to count the number of fingers you have on one hand and end up with six instead of five. you look up at the creature, sure now that it can’t hurt you; not trapped in your head like this.
>
> “bring me your most valuable possession and i will reward you. leave it at the mouth of the forest, under the tree with eyes and you will feel fulfillment greater than anything promised to you before.”
>
> it smiles and somehow the expression pulls past the long curve of its jaw. it smiles wider and wider, until you notice that its teeth aren’t the squared off molars of a deer meant for grinding up grass. they’re long and sharp. when it laughs, it sounds like a scream. or, no. that’s you. you’re screaming. you’re waking yourself up with it in the balmy hold of night. you won’t forget it.

### SNAKE

> THE ANTLER GOD ENTERS YOUR DREAM —
>
> on your nightstand, you have the mirror your family gave you, propped up and easy to see. you’re used to your face, the tired features that the night invites. but this time, when you look into the glass, it isn’t yourself that you see. your face is an empty shell of a thing; devoid of a nose or a mouth or eyes. you’re not sure how you’re seeing anything with no eyes (where are your eyes?), but you are. and so you can watch as your face changes. the skin melts and drips to the floor and a skull emerges, horns sprouting from the top and your not-eyes start to burn as you take in its image. you wrench your impossible gaze away from the mirror and suddenly that same skull is in front of you instead of inside you.
>
> “bring me your most valuable possession and i will reward you. leave it at the mouth of the forest, under the tree with eyes. follow me, and find the truth.”
>
> you look back to the mirror and you’re wearing your face again. you hear yourself breathing too fast, feel your feet tangled in your sheets. you’re awake, but you still feel its presence in the dark. you won’t forget it.

### DOVE

> THE ANTLER GOD ENTERS YOUR DREAM —
>
> outside, a wind chime scatters into a discordant melody. by now you’re used to it. like white noise, it helps you fall asleep. the chiming continues, even in your dream. ahead, in the forest of your mind, you see a stag. it looks like it’s from the prehistoric times with how it towers high among the trees. you crane your head back to look up at its face- or, at what should be its face. the meat of it has been worn down and all that remains is a skull, a limpid ivory in the moonlight. its jaw cracks like a tree collapsing as it starts to speak. its voice so resonant you feel the ground shake underneath your feet.
>
> “i have a task for you. follow me and we will all find our way to greatness. bring with you your most valuable possession and make your way into the mouth of the woods. find the tree with eyes and gather everything you have found at its base. bring it up the mountain, to the high peak, and leave everything below the inscribed tree. give me my offerings and i will give you power in exchange.”
>
> while it speaks, its body changes. now it has hands, and it reaches out to offer you one. you take it, and it guides you into the forest and high up the mountain. you both stop in front of the strange tree it spoke of. you look up at it and watch as lightning snakes down from the sky and splits it down the middle. it blinds you, and when you open your eyes, you’re awake in your bed.

### FOLLOW UP - IF THEY GAVE THE HEIRLOOM

> the antler god visits you in your dreams once more, it’s wearing a smile. it means to look reassuring, surely. it just hasn’t gotten used to its face yet. it doesn’t know the long shape of its own jaw. its sharp teeth saw together as it speaks. “you have proven yourself useful. you have proven yourself better than your ancestors of old. i keep my promises, i grant you a boon.”
>
> _your muse has a bout of good fortune for one in-character week. they might: find money on the floor, a bill may have been sent in error, if they were ill then they might get better, they suddenly get a promotion. however, the good luck should only surround the character themselves and not be overreaching_

### FOLLOW UP - IF THEY DID NOT GIVE THE HEIRLOOM

> the antler god visits you in your dreams once more. or, no-that’s not right. it’s easy to see right away that this is not a dream, but a nightmare. the forest grows around you like a cage, bears and foxes snarling from behind the branches, salivating so heavily it drips down their jaws as they snap their teeth. from the trees, the crows cackle. the antler god stands before you, larger than the last time you saw it. “you have disobeyed me. you have strayed from your purpose. but i will teach you that it’s easier to fall into step than to turn against me. the past isn’t something worth repeating. i will give you another chance, bring me your most valuable possession, what your family passed down to you, to the tree with eyes.” the antler god disappears, and the animals descend upon you, teeth first.
>
> you muse has a bout of bad luck for one in-character day. they might: step in puddle, trip and skin their knee, get a demotion at their job, lose money, etc.

## OF THE FOREST

### STAG

> YOU WAKE UP SORE AND COVERED IN DIRT —
> this isn’t new. you don’t always make it home again before you wake up, but this time you did. your hands and arms ache, and your joints are stiff. mud is caked underneath your nails. it’s all over, streaked in your hair and inside of your socks. it’s not the rich brown of the earth, but a clay-red that gleams in the sun. dirt is scattered across your bed. you don’t know what you did, but you know where you went. somewhere in the woods. it’s always the woods.
>
> DO YOU…
>
> **ignore it**: nothing happens
>
> **go back into the woods during the day**
>
> **bottle up some of the dirt and check in with one of the ginseng farmers to ask if they notice anything special about it**

#### **IF THEY GO BACK INTO THE WOODS DURING THE DAY**

> your body starts to relax, the same way it always does when you get this deep in the woods. if only your mind would do the same. it buzzes with the warnings your grandmother used to tell you, which you refuse to heed, even if if you’re not conscious for the transgressions. you are for this one though and that makes you feel worse. you’ve been walking for at least two hours when you start noticing the change in earth. the higher up you go, the more it changes into that clay-red you buried your bed in. in your chest your heart beats inexplicably faster.
>
> DO YOU…
>
> **head home**: nothing happens
>
> **continue on**:
>
> > you climb higher up the mountain, for long enough that you start wishing you brought a water bottle. finally, you reach your destination. you can tell it’s your destination because there’s a hole in the ground with piles of dirt all around it, looking like a meteor struck it from the inside out. there’s a tree standing guard above it, the bark tinged black from a burn, a crack running down the middle. you creep closer, and your heart picks up in time with you. at the edge of the hole, you peer down. inside is a coffin stood up vertically, the dirt packed down around the bottom shows it was buried that way. the lid is sealed shut by an uneven line of nails that look rusted. there are ribbons of cut up flowers ringing the box like a decoration. or, no, not a box. a coffin buried wrong. you feel a shiver drag down your spine like ice despite the heat. something in you tells you to leave, to run. but there’s another piece, the part that you hide away that feels strangely…at home. you move in closer, ignoring the dirt now lodged inside of your shoes. you swear you can hear the light scratching of something coming from inside the coffin.

#### **IF THEY BOTTLE UP DIRT AND TAKE TO FARMER**

> you head through town and toward the farmlands. a lot of them work with the soil, they must know more about it than you do. after getting passed around to a few people, you end up with a man who nods knowingly at the empty jam jar you swept the dirt into. “up higher in the mountains i’d say. the higher you go, the redder it gets. i wouldn’t go up there if i were you, though. lots of snakes. lots of poison ivy. that’s what my mother used to say, anyway.”
>
> DO YOU…
>
> **heed the farmer’s warning and stay in town**: nothing happens
>
> **travel through the woods and up the mountain**:
>
> > you climb higher up the mountain, for long enough that you start wishing you brought a water bottle. finally, you reach your destination. you can tell it’s your destination because there’s a hole in the ground with piles of dirt all around it, looking like a meteor struck it from the inside out. there’s a tree standing guard above it, the bark tinged black from a burn. a crack running down the middle. you creep closer, and your heart picks up in time with you. at the edge of the hole you peer down. inside is a coffin stood up vertically, the dirt packed down around the bottom shows it was buried that way. the lid is left open like a door. there is nothing inside.

### BAT

> THE ANTLER GOD WHISPERS INTO YOUR EAR—
> “you have always lived in the mountains, sheltered by the forest. and to the forest, you shall return.” curious, you follow the order. it hasn’t asked you to enter to forest for so many years. you do it yourself, sometimes. it’s a comforting place. but this is different, it feels charged, meaningful. at the mouth of the forest you see magpie. it feels like an echo of the past. like before, you link hands and out of habit, you find yourself retracing the path you took so long ago as a child. the memory stops repeating when they hit the crossroads where the split from each other so long ago. in your head, you hear it’s voice “follow a new path, higher instead of deeper.” and next to bat, magpie speaks in a voice that isn’t quite theirs, “this way, up higher.” you walk high up into the mountain and stand before a hole in the earth. standing upright in the middle is a coffin, once buried vertically. wrapped in long lengths around the coffin are vines, sprouting thick bushels of purple flowers that you’ve never seen before. the voice picks up in your ear once again, “free me from my bindings, i will protect you.”

### MAGPIE

> THE ANTLER GOD USES YOUR MOUTH AND SPEAKS—
> “you need to pick up that knife.” you’re standing in your kitchen, and you stare at the block of knives sitting on the counter. you’re the one who controls your own hands, but the longer you stand there waiting, the more it wears out your jaw. “you need to pick up that knife.” frustrated by yourself, you turn and dig through a drawer instead to fish out a folding knife. you already seem strange enough to the people in town without walking around with a cleaver. you shove it in your pocket and resume making breakfast when you interrupt yourself again. “you need to go to the forest.” you tell yourself in a voice that isn’t quite your own. you keep telling yourself through bites of cereal until you get fed up enough that you do as you’re told. that’s when you see bat. that’s when you both go in together, in the same way as before. when you were kids. at the crosspath where you once separated, you watch bat cock their head. you almost ask before you interrupt yourself, “this way, up higher.” so you both do just that. until you find a hole. standing upright in the middle of it is a coffin, once buried vertically. wrapped in long lengths around the coffin are vines, sprouting thick bushels of purple flowers that you’ve never seen before. bat tells you that you need to free it. you hear your mouth agreeing as you draw out your knife.

### FOLLOW UP FOR BAT AND MAGPIE

> you finish unwinding and cutting the long tendrils of vines away from the coffin. it’s not until they’re all cleared away that you notice it’s sealed shut. no amount of prying with the knife will free it. maybe you can come back a different day. maybe you should never come back again.

### ELK

> YOU HEAR YOUR SIBLING’S VOICE CALLING FROM THE TREES—
> which doesn’t make sense, because your sibling’s been gone for a while now. but you hear it clear as day as you’re walking near the treeline, their voice calling your name; young and warbling like the birds singing behind it. it doesn’t make sense, but you follow it anyway. you crash too fast through the underbrush and chase the voice that sounds like it’s running from you, like it’s luring you. by the time it halts, echoes around you in a laugh, you’re panting and tired. the back of your throat is dry, even if the sun can’t reach you between the thick blanket of leaves overhead. at your feet is a briar patch. it’s sprawling and overgrown for as far as you can see. the thorns of it are thick, curved, waiting like fish hooks in a pond. and in the middle, sitting like bait, is the bracelet you gave to your sibling on their very last birthday, woven from colorful string, now desaturated after so many years exposed. they were here and now, so are you.
> DO YOU…
>
> **leave the bracelet be and return home**
>
> **reach into the briars and take it**

#### **IF THEY LEAVE BRACELET**

> as you turn to leave you reach out and steady yourself on the trunk of a tree. the bark’s rough against your hand, but you only stick to that thought for a moment, because those blurry pictures are swimming behind your eyes again. you see your sibling at the edge of the same briar patch, their eyes wide. it doesn’t look like they’re staring at it, rather, into it. like there’s a scene playing out only for them. after a while they blink hard and sink down to their hands and knees to crawl inside. you watch the way the thorns catch and gnaw at them as they reach in deep and pull the antler shard out. the one you keep with you now. they crawl back out again, their cheeks stained wine red from the cold. because there’s snow piled up at their feet. snow in the air. too much snow. you can’t see anything. they can’t find their way home. and then, you can’t find them in the blizzard that swallows them up. you try to call out to them, but instead of hearing them reply, there’s just the screech of a bird above you. you look up, and it’s a blanket of green. you’re here, in the now. in summer. they’re gone. you turn and leave the briars as fast as your legs let you.

#### **IF THEY TAKE BRACELET**

> you crouch down and peer between the thorny branches to find the best angle to reach in. you slowly reach your arm in, feeling around half-blind for the bracelet. you feel the rough strands of it and clutch it in your grip. the vision that hits you after you touch is so hard that you almost feel like you’re really there. it’s the vision fault that you jerk back, that a torn catches your wrist. that when you pull back, it pulls forward tears away a strip of skin. you drip blood to the earth, but you’re not focused on that. you’re focused on the sight of your sibling in front of you, reaching into the briars the same way you did, only in the middle of winter and crawling through snowbanks. you watch as their bracelet catches on thorns on the way out. how they stand up triumphant and smile at you, gap toothed and wide.you almost reach out, try to touch them. your vision have never felt like this before. like you’ve been transplanted into them. before you have a chance, your sibling warps in front of you. bones crack and shift, and their body stretches. out of their skull sprouts two horns. “i have a taste for you now. it will be easier if you stop resisting me. if you stop resisting the forest’s call.” behind the creature’s back, your sibling, perpetually trapped at the age you lost them, laughs like a game and darts off back toward home. a place they will never step foot in again.
>
> YOU HAVE FED YOUR BLOOD TO THE SOIL THE ANTLER GOD REIGNS OVER. YOU FEEL YOUR CONNECTION DEEPEN —
> the visions your muse now receives no longer seem to have a distorted film over them and are easier for you to discern.

## ORDER OF THE RABBITS

### COTTONTAIL

> YOU REMEMBER —
>
> you and your friends, the rabbits, as children. you’re laughing, playing and dancing in a circle. you have bare feet, mud covering your knees and hands. you run through tall grass and trees screaming in an imitation of wolves. you stop by the river, tired and panting like a dog after the chase. you all gorge yourself on the stream water and fat berries growing nearly overripe on its banks. the memory won’t leave you, and you find you have a compulsion to revisit it, to taste the sharp tang of that fruit once more. on the way out the door, you hesitate before reaching for that old book. you tuck deep into your bag before you set off.

### ANGORA

> YOU REMEMBER —
>
> yourself as a child, running through the forest, the tall trees and the dark shadows as you wound your way through them. your friends, the rabbits, were sticking to your sides and that was the only reason you didn’t turn around and run back home. you loped long-legged through the brush and ignored the way the rocks stuck to your heels. you jumped and danced and as you all grew louder, you grew bolder too. after a while, you found some berries on the bank of the stream. young enough to play pretend, you all made a banquet of the fruit - playing at royalty. you find yourself wanting to revisit it, drawn like a magnet, even if you you still hate those woods and the long, dark shadows that live between the trees.

### BRUSH

> YOU REMEMBER —
>
> when you were young, a step behind the rest of your friends - the other rabbits. you were just as fast, but you liked to watch where they landed first, to evade the sharp pebbles or snakes wrapped up in themselves and basking in the sun. you howled just as loud as the rest of them and bared your teeth like a wolf as you played. you spun in dizzying circles, and drank down fistfuls of water when you all collapsed down by the river. you helped pluck the berries from the bushes lining its bank. you ate them until they stained your tongue a bright red. it hits you like a train, this memory, and you suddenly want to go back and find it, taste those berries again. you want to do this more than anything you ever have before, or ever will again.

### MARSH

> YOU REMEMBER —
>
> a time when you were young and exploring the forest with your friends, the other rabbits. you jumped from shadow to shadow and caught a snake in your hands. you all pretended to raise your hackles and run wild like a pack of wolves. you danced and sang up at the songbirds, a childish warble as you pretended to communicate with them. you made it deep in the woods, deeper than your parents would’ve let you go, if only they knew about it. you grabbed fistfuls of berries with your friends, mashed them up into a jam and drank it like syrup. you realize now, that the taste never left you. that you need these berries once more. that you need to follow the same path you did as a child and find them. you need to find them.

### AFTER THEY EAT THE BERRIES

> YOU SHARED IN MY FEAST, AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU —
>
> after eating the berries again, you feel calmer than you have in years. almost complete, like you were only one-fourth of a person before. you navigate back to your friends, the other rabbits, and as you look into their eyes you know they shared the same experience. you know they went back into the woods, too. you know they ate the berries, too. you come closer and laugh together, almost nervous. and then cottontail/you pull(s) out that book and sets it in the ground in the middle of everyone. a page calls out, you can all feel it, and cottontail/you turns to it. while it never had before, suddenly it seems to make sense to you all. you twine your fingers together. you recite the words it asks you to. you feel the completeness of your being slot into place. you know it now, when you’re together you’re whole.

## INVASIVE SPECIES

### FIELDMOUSE

> YOU ARE WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST —
>
> with only a vague purpose in mind, to catalogue the fauna that you come across. the sooner you finish, the sooner you can leave town again. the farther in that you walk, the harder it is to keep that goal at the forefront of your mind. you’re more concerned with the forest itself. with the overgrowth of ferns underfoot and the sonorant birds trilling overhead. you pause to document a berry bush you remember from your childhood, and out from behind it staggers a rabbit. it bounds out lopsided and away from you, but then it stops and looks back at you, like it’s waiting for you to follow. its eyes flash a milky white.
>
> DO YOU…
>
> **follow the rabbit**
>
> **go back home**

#### **IF THEY FOLLOW THE RABBIT**

> you follow after the rabbit as it takes its long, lurching steps. every so often it pauses and looks back at you in wait. the deeper you get into the forest, the less light is able to break through the leaves above. it halts briefly in the middle of the fairy ring and you watch as one ear twitches. you almost believe this is where it was leading you, but then it darts off again in a tripping hop through the long weeds on the way toward the marshlands. it pauses again in the shallows of the bracken water. around it grow a species of mushroom you’ve never seen before. it’s so vibrant that it almost looks like it’s glowing.you’re almost entirely sure nobody has catalogued this before. this discovery could put you on the map. you pull out a small bag and take a sample to study later.

#### **IF THEY GO BACK HOME**

> you trek back out from the woods and ignore the way the rabbit lurches after you. every so often it lets out a hitching squeal, and you look back expecting its leg to be caught in a trap. every time, the rabbit sits and stares expectantly at you. almost angry. by the time you make it out of the woods it’s baring its teeth and chattering out in a pitch that feels wrong, that sounds anxious, that walks down your arms in gooseflesh. you can’t help but wonder what it was trying to lead you toward.

### STARLING

> YOU CAME HOME FOR A REASON —
>
> but lately all you can do is think about leaving again, even if you don’t have the means to do so. for what might be the tenth time this month, you go online to look up the price for a train ticket to somewhere far away. this time, the webpage seems to freeze. it’s not unusual, you’re at home and not in the epicenter of wifi hotspots, the local cafe. the usual dead page screen pops up, and you move to exit out from it, but before you do, you notice the loading wheel is still spinning. that you’re being redirected. the page doesn’t have a lot on it, but it still feels like too much. you move to exit out of the screen, but before you can do so a popup appears. there’s a lot of small print text you can’t really make out, and it doesn’t improve when you zoom in, but you think you spot the word cookies at the bottom are your two standard options, I ACCEPT and DECLINE.
>
> DO YOU…
>
> **press I ACCEPT**
>
> **press I DECLINE**

#### **IF THEY ACCEPT**

> you press the accept button and the page slowly starts to load in. the url looks strange, like it came from the very early days of the internet when web pages were basic and blocky in favor of the streamlined modernity of today. in the middle of the page you see a floating WELCOME that looks like it might’ve been made in paint. underneath it is a file, a random string of numbers with a play button next to it.
>
> DO YOU...
>
> **click the play button** > **exit out from the website**
>
> > #### **IF THEY CLICK THE PLAY BUTTON**
> >
> > you turn up the volume on your computer and listen as sound crackles out from the speaker. it’s low quality, grainy, and at first you think the blanket of static is all that will play. but after a moment, a voice crackles to life. not any voice. yours. at first you think it must be an old podcast, and the website thrown together from some overeager fan who got you to click a redirection link. but the more you listen, the more you realize that it’s not. that you haven’t ever said anything sliding its way out from your speakers.
> >
> > “i’m back in town. it’s nice here, nicer than i remembered. i’m glad that i accepted it. i just want to say…welcome home. welcome home. welcome home.”
> > the end catches like a glitch, and with every repetition the voice sounds less like your own. the vowels elongated, the tonality shifted into something that sounds wrong. into something that sounds like no human could make. you slam the lid of your laptop shut and take a deep breath in. maybe it’s a joke. or someone really did redirect your url. maybe someone who was pissed off you covered them during your true crime days. you push the laptop away and try to push everything else out of your memory. you don’t realize you’ve forgotten about train ticket shopping altogether.
> >
> > #### **IF THEY EXIT**
> >
> > you click the back button, you’ve had enough of it. the popup prevents you from leaving though, so you navigate down and hit the x to close it first. all that does is duplicate it. you try again, now you have four, then six. with each duplication, the more uneasy you feel. you slam down the lid on your laptop instead. instead of powering down into a hibernation state, it seems to turn on some read to text feature instead. a script of too fast terms and services followed by the options: I ACCEPT or I DECLINE. trying to decline doesn't work, only prompting the question again and again. it seems like you only have one choice - to press I ACCEPT. (loop up to i accept response from above)

### FOX

> EVERYTHING FEELS AVERAGE —
>
> and that feels like an annoyance. but you’re looking forward to getting the ticket for a recent concert in the mail; it signals one day out of this town and that feels like a reprieve. so you stop by your mailbox on the way inside. you find more than usual, but you don’t sort through it right away, until you’re safe in your home. the majority of the envelopes, aside from your electricity bill, are blank. you open them up one by one to find simple sentences typed on plain paper:
>
> how to set down your roots and keep them there
>
> why this is the best choice for you
>
> submit and flourish
>
> forget about your past
>
> forget about everything but the future
>
> you look at the scattered pages around you. it feels like a practical joke, but you can’t think up who would think it was funny. you crumple up the papers and notice one last envelope left behind, it’s smaller than the rest, it had gotten lost in the shuffle. it looks about the right size for a concert ticket though, and you peel back the flap as you try to shake the strangeness of the earlier letters. what you shake out looks like it should be a ticket, but instead of the show name and your information, there is only a QR code in the center. maybe it’s a new ticket delivery system, a bureaucratic nightmare process to electronically provide your ticket while simultaneously wasting paper.
>
> DO YOU…
>
> **use the QR code**
>
> **throw out everything**

#### **IF THEY USE THE QR CODE**

> you take out your phone to capture the QR code and watch as a page slowly loads onto the screen. the webpage is blurry because centered in front of it is your average terms of service agreement. what you can make out behind it looks like it might be tickets, though. either way, you’re intrigued now about what it might be.
>
> DO YOU...
>
> **press I ACCEPT**
>
> **press I DECLINE**
>
> #### **IF THEY ACCEPT**
>
> > you press accept on your screen and wait for the page to load in. it looks like the information that an electronic ticket might have, but it’s all wrong. it doesn’t match up with what you’ve purchased. your name is there, but instead of an artist or a venue, the ticket is just for onyang. not a bus or a location. just onyang. in the middle of the page it reads: welcome, enjoy your stay. return tickets currently frozen. you frown, it reminds you of all the fake letters from earlier. not everyone in town likes you, maybe it is some fucked up joke. you almost put your phone back to sleep when you notice that there’s a command running to open a new app, the ticketing site. you watch as it navigates to your profile, and then the ticket. you frown and press the sleep button, but nothing happens. instead, the refund button is pressed and your ticket is cancelled out. you’re angry, and then worried. you click out from the program and stand up, maybe to find another phone. or bring yours to the hardware store and hope someone there can help. you make it all the way to the front door when you realize you’re out of milk. instead of worrying about your phone, you head to the nearby grocery mart. by the time you’re home, you’ve forgotten about the concert and your missing ticket altogether.
>
> #### **IF THEY DECLINE**
>
> > your phone seems to freeze for a moment, and then the screen goes dark. you frown and tap at the button to wake it up. it’s your home screen, but the popup still remains. you decide to restart the phone completely, but it’s still there. no amount of tapping I DECLINE seem to help.

#### **IF THEY THROW EVERYTHING OUT**

> you collect all the letters and move to drop them all in the recycling. you take a deep breath and shake the memory from your head. these are unimportant, a joke. you need to focus on you, not this town. it’s never done anything to help you. to help anybody. you’re not sure how so many people can’t seem to understand that. so you move on with your life, or you mean to. but the next day, sitting in your mailbox, is a vibrant purple envelope with a picture of an eye. you open it and find another QR code. underneath is a typewritten message, but the longer the sentence continue, the more slanted the words become, like the printer forgot how to do its job properly halfway through. ‘last chance’ is set in ink, sloped down the page.

> **same options as above** (use QR, or ignore)

### HARE

> YOU REMEMBER —
> playing with your friends, the rabbits, near the edge of the woods as a child. you remember them shrieking and laughing and daring each other toward the edge. you remember staring at a wall of trees and listening to the wind howl through the thicket. you remember the feeling of dread in your gut. you remember not following them in. you remember the way that they frowned at you. you remember the way they all climbed out of the woods later, their faces smeared berry red, their legs mud-streaked. you don’t know why you’re remembering it, just that you are. that it seems important. that you want to know. there has been an unspoken divide ever since, a distinct separation of them and you- can you trace it back to that day? you continue to harp on this when one day you spot a rabbit heading back into the forest. your curiosity stretches like a shadow looking to attach to their back, you wonder what they’re doing.
>
> DO YOU ...
>
> **follow the rabbit into the forest quietly**
>
> **ignore them (nothing good comes from the forest)**

#### **IF THEY FOLLOW**

> the rabbit leads you to that memory, and then farther. you didn't follow them that day, but you know instinctively that this is where they went. the rabbit hops over to a berry bush by the river bank and nibbles on one of the berries, mouth twitching, one eye staring at you. you know what it wants you do to. you know you shouldn't. but before you realize it, a berry bursts in your mouth and leaves a tangy aftertaste on your tongue. you don't know why, but you feel... different, now. calm. when you look down, the rabbit is gone. you don't remember the way out, but you're not worried. somehow, you know the forest will safely guide you home
>
> _hare gets the same submit as the rabbits after eating the berries_

#### **IF THEY IGNORE**

> you watch the forest swallow them whole as they retreat into the dark throat of it. it should be easy to walk away from that forest, from them, but this time it isn’t. you linger for a beat too long, like your feet are cement-stuck in place. all you do is squint after the form of them until you can no longer convince yourself that you can make out their shape through the trees. even as you turn to leave, you find yourself backtracking, until you’ve trampled down a small iteration of a race track that you’ve set yourself loose on. it’s when you finally notice what you’re doing that you stop.
>
> with great effort, you pull yourself away from the forest. from whatever it is the rabbits are getting up to. you don’t belong there, you think. maybe you don’t even belong in onyang. you refuse to look back over your shoulder as you walk away. even as you feel the pointed stare of eyes on your back.

### CAT

> YOU’RE FEELING STIR CRAZY —
>
> but it’s raining outside, so you don’t even want to take laps around the town. you're stuck in your cramped home listening to the rain clatter against the roof. all you want to do is watch a show on netflix, but your wifi connection keeps cutting in and out, leaving the actors in an eternal buffering state. the rain always makes the internet even worse than it already is. you sigh, and try to decide what to occupy your time with when your phone rings. you’re a bit surprised, usually if your wifi is out, then your phone is spotty too. you fish it out of your pocket and answer it. on the other end of the line is a robotic, scripted voice.
>
> “hello CAT, you have a voicemail from” your phone cuts out, though that’s surprising, but it picks up connection again to finish the message “press 1 for I ACCEPT, press 2 for MORE OPTIONS”
>
> DO YOU…
>
> **press 1**
>
> **press 2**

#### **IF THEY PRESS 1**

> you’re bored enough to entertain the strange call. you press 1 and listen as the receiver clicks, but whoever is on the other end of the line doesn’t speak. you wait for too long, long enough to hear the rasping breath on the other end of the line. if it were possible, you’d call it damp. finally, they speak. or…something speaks. an ai voice, maybe. distorted and catching, like whoever programmed it couldn’t figure out how to make it sound human. “thank you for accepting. don’t worry. be at ease. you’ll feel like you’re a part of something soon enough.” the message clicks to a stop and your phone beeps. weird. you go to delete the message out of your voicemail, but you don’t find anything there.

#### **IF THEY PRESS 2**

> you’re bored enough to entertain the strange call. you press 2, hoping you’ll get an option to replay the message in its entirety to catch the section that you missed. the robotic voice picks up again “to AGREE, press 1 now. to AGREE, press 2 now. to AGREE, press 3 now. to AGREE, press 4 now. to hear the options again, press 0. hanging up is not an option.” in either an act of rebellion or to test the theory, you press the end call button. but your phone remains on, the hint of classical music emanating from your phone just loud enough for you to realize you’re still in the call. you feel your heart pound.
>
> DO YOU...
>
> **press one** (loop up to above option)
>
> **power your phone off**
>
> > your heart beats loud in your chest and you grip your phone so tight that your fist starts shaking. it’s stupid, you think. just a weird glitch. you hold your finger down on the power button until it force-shuts itself down. you sigh and slide it onto your desk, refocus your attention on your slightly buffered show when it rings again. it shouldn’t, it’s off. but you see the screen light up and the flash of an incoming call. the same number as before. it seems like you can’t escape it.
> >
> > DO YOU ...
> >
> > **answer the call and press 1** (loop up to above press 1 option)
> >
> > **destroy the phone**
> >
> > > you pick up your ringing phone, move to the bathroom, and drop it into the sink. you turn on the water and watch as it slowly starts to submerge. well, maybe that was an overreaction. now you don’t have a phone.
